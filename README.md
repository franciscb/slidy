simple slideshare made out of a dictionary. instead of creating some google slides with ideas about the workshop, i decided to create a slideshare script, that is the presentation itself.

Data is kept in data.py in a list with dictionaries (don't ask me why)


Please feel free to fork the project and add any modifications.



Currently it lacks:
1. Main Function
2. Better way of navigating through slides

Try and follow the pattern of creating methods that do one thing only.

Tasks you can do:

1. Make a better navigation. Instead of pressing enter after > or < - make it to slide just by pressing a key
2. Make it show slides from a file, instead of the hard coded dictionary
   2.1. You can create your own file format and create a method that imports it to a dictionary/list or whatever structure you choose
3. Can add some pagination
      Saying like Slide 1 out of 10 that is displayed on each slide.
